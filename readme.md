## Introduction

This is my first major Javascript project from the Javascript complete course by Jonas Scmedtmann, it's a perfect example of shaocasing my skills up to and including DOM Manipulation. Originally found on [Udemy, The Javascript Complete Course by Jonas Scmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/),
the project was designed to be a version of the popular pig game, i did however use it as a learning opportunity to get a deeper understanding into html / css and JS / Dom manipulation, even going so far as to add new features to the game.

### Why This?

It was the first project I wanted to utilize to showoff my progress with javascript and as a result one that i felt would fit on the portfolio. There is more work to be done on it in the future when i learn more but for now it's a good example of what I have learnt

## Project Brief

### In Depth Description

The project uses an HTML / CSS based GUI that take inputs in the form of strings and decides the players. It then allows the players to roll a dice to accumulate a score. And let's them keep playing until they tally the score required to win, it then allows to reset the game and go again.

Originally as stated the project didn't have any realy player selection and much less visual presence in some ways, so I decided to learn more about how the code works to build a warmer more noticable UI, and add more elements to showcase the winner. As well as this player selection functions

## Learning Points & Takeaway

This project made me learn more about HTML and CSS as well as researching the tools needed to implement functionality outside of the intended scope.

## Version History

v.01 - Created base game and added extended functionality to it
